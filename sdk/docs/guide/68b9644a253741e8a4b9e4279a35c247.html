<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> uses data binding to bind two data sources or information sources together to
		keep them in synch: All changes in one data source are also reflected in the other data
		source.</p>
<p class="p">For data binding, you need a <dfn class="term">model</dfn> and a <dfn class="term">data binding</dfn> instance: The
				<dfn class="term">model</dfn> instance holds the data and provides methods to set the data or
			to retrieve the data from a server. It also provides a method for creating bindings to
			the data. When this method is called, a <dfn class="term">data binding</dfn> instance is created,
			which contains the binding information and provides an event, which is fired whenever
			the bound data is changed. An element can listen to this event and update its
			visualization according to the new data. </p>
<p class="p">The UI usually uses data binding to bind UI controls to the model, which holds the application
			data, so that the controls are updated automatically whenever application data is
			changed. The data binding is also used when changes in the control cause updates in the
			underlying application data, such as data being entered by a user. This is called
			two-way binding.</p>
<p class="p">The default binding mode for model implementations (if not implemented otherwise) is
			two-way binding and the supported binding modes by the model are one-way binding,
			two-way binding and one-time binding. The default binding mode can be changed by the
			application for each model instance. A model implementation should specify its supported
			binding modes and set the default binding mode accordingly (e.g. if the model supports
			only one way binding the default binding mode should also be set to one way).</p>

The binding mode defines how the data sources are bound. The different model 		implementations require specific binding modes. The resource model, for example, only 		supports one-time binding, that is, a binding from the model to the view.</li>
