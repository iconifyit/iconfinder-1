<h1 class="title topictitle1">Creating Navigation Targets</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"/>
<p class="p">Users can use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Open In…</span> button in the footer of an APF-based runtime
			application to navigate to other applications. The context of the current analysis path
			including start filters and other filters such as selections made in the charts up to
			the active analysis step are handed over to the other application.</p>
<p class="p">When the user navigates back to the APF-based application, the analysis path is reloaded
			in exactly the same status as it was when navigating to the other application, that is,
			all analysis steps and all selections made are retained.</p>
<p class="p">You can define multiple navigation targets for each configuration. To create a navigation
			target, click <span class="ph menucascade"><img src="images/navstart.gif" alt="Start of the navigation path" title="Start of the navigation path"/> <span class="ph uicontrol">Add</span> <img src="images/navstep.gif" alt="Next navigation step" title="Next navigation step"/> <span class="ph uicontrol">New Navigation Target</span> <img src="images/navend.gif" alt="End of the navigation path" title="End of the navigation path"/></span>. Enter the semantic object and action as defined in the corresponding
			target mapping configured in the Fiori launchpad designer. The description is taken over
			from the target mapping. As soon as you enter a semantic object, the value help for the
			action is filled with all actions that are available for this target mapping and that
			you are authorized for. The Action field is prefilled with the first action in this
			list.</p>
<p class="p">At runtime, the navigation targets are displayed in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Open In…</span> dialog
			in the same order as they appear in the tree structure. You can change the order of the
			navigation targets by moving them up or down the tree structure using the arrow icons. </p>
<p class="p">The list of navigation targets in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Open In…</span> dialog can be
			different from user to user. Whether a navigation target is visible for a user depends
			on the following:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loiod5762bcb9bf047d6a1b2db2b92f8fa69__ul_q2d_5xf_kr"><li class="li">
				<p class="p">The user is authorized for the target mapping of the navigation target. This is
					the case if the user has a role to which the catalog is assigned which contains
					the target mapping.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">The navigation target supports the form factor the user is currently using:
					desktop, tablet, or smartphone. This is also configured in the target
					mapping.</p>

			</li>
</ul>
