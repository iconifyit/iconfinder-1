			<p class="p">The app is made up of a number of moving parts, which are shown in this diagram:</p>

			<p class="p">Let's have a quick tour of how the app is put together, visiting each file in turn.
			</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Index, Component and Message Bundle</div><div type="Index, Component and Message Bundle">
			
			<p class="p">In the beginning the browser loads the web application's
					<span class="ph filepath">index.html</span> which contains only minimal code. It loads the
				<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> toolkit core using the standard variant bootstrap script tag, and there is a
				single function call to instantiate an
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer</samp> and place it in the body of the
				HTML document. The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer</samp> loads an
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.UIComponent</samp> which is the self-contained
				encapsulation of the whole application. </p>

			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.UIComponent</samp> (henceforth referred to as the
					'<dfn class="term">Component</dfn>') is defined in the <span class="ph filepath">Component.js</span>
				file in the same folder as <span class="ph filepath">index.html</span>; it is found through the
				specification of resource locations in the bootstrap tag - see the Bootstrap section
				for more details. The Component has metadata defined, which includes
				application-level configuration and routing information. Routing is the key best
				practice navigation mechanism and for non-trivial apps supersedes
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.EventBus</samp>-based navigation, and even
				shared-controller-based access to the top-level navigation control (such as an
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.NavContainer</samp>). </p>

			<p class="p">In the initialization part of the Component, models are created and set on the component: the
				main model that connects to the OData source, and some helper models for
				internationalization (i18n), where the texts are loaded from a local resource
					<samp class="ph codeph">messageBundle.properties</samp>, and device detection based
				arrangement of user interface (UI) controls. Further, the initialization of the
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.routing.Router</samp> (the Router) is performed. In the
				main section of the Component the root view ('<dfn class="term">App</dfn>') is instantiated.
				Like all the other views in this sample app, the root view is an XML view. </p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">The Views and Fragments</div><div type="The Views and Fragments">
			
			<p dir="ltr" class="p">The root view <dfn class="term">App</dfn>, defined in <span class="ph filepath">App.view.xml</span>, is
				very simple and contains a single <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.SplitApp</samp> control. Neither
				the master nor the detail pages aggregations are filled at this time in the view
				definition; this is all managed by the Router, which is also the reason why there's
				no explicit requirement for a controller connected to this view.</p>

			<p dir="ltr" class="p">The visible part of the sample app is provided by three main XML views and a
				fragment. When displayed on devices other than a smartphone, there are two views
				shown - the master and the detail. Initially this is the
					<span class="ph filepath">Master.view.xml</span> and the
					<span class="ph filepath">Detail.view.xml</span> . Each of these views contain an
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Page</samp>. There's also
				<span class="ph filepath">NotFound.view.xml</span>, to be used when no view can be matched to
				the resource requested. There is also the AddProduct view
					(<span class="ph filepath">AddProduct.view.xml</span>) which is shown in the detail pages
				aggregation when the <span class="ph uicontrol">add product</span> button is pressed. There are
				no direct dependencies between views. </p>

			<p dir="ltr" class="p">In the Detail view there is a couple of
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout.form.SimpleForm</samp> controls to display the supplier
				address and category details. These controls are defined separately in XML fragments
					<span class="ph filepath">SupplierAddressForm.fragment.xml</span> and
					<span class="ph filepath">CategoryInfoForm.fragment.xml</span>. They are included in the
				Detail view using the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Fragment</samp> element. Finally,
				there's another fragment <span class="ph filepath">NameRequiredDialog.fragment.xml</span>, where
				a Dialog control is defined, to be shown if no name is specified in the new product
				form.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Other Files</div><div type="Other Files">
			
			<p dir="ltr" class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">Formatter.js</span> file contains formatting utilities
				that are used in various controls within the Master and Detail views. </p>

			<p dir="ltr" class="p">The css folder contains <span class="ph filepath">style.css</span> which has a very
				small amount of custom CSS, specifically to position the "not found" message further
				down that it would normally sit.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">The Overall Folder Structure</div><div type="The Overall Folder Structure">
			
			<p class="p">The folder structure containing all the resources mentioned in this overview looks

			<p class="p">So now we have an idea of what our app should consist of, let's start building
				it.</p>

		</div></div>
</div>
<div class="related-links"> 
<div class="childtopics">In this section:</div><ul class="ullinks">
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="f6998380aeb94af6917eff27aa5cc14c.html">Step 1: Index</a></strong><br/>
Because an application would normally live in a folder, and the default file that web 		servers return when the folder itself is requested is often configured to be 			<span class="ph filepath">index.html</span>, the name of our app's index HTML file is indeed 			<span class="ph filepath">index.html</span>.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="170638b7a2b4424e8580fb473af6a3cd.html">Step 2: Component</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="688f36bd758e4ce2b4e682eef4dc794e.html">Step 3: Navigation and Routing</a></strong><br/>
A new Routing mechanism was introduced to <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> in release 1.16. For in-app navigation, 		this supersedes previous techniques such as using the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.EventBus</samp> 		or sharing navigation-container specific controller code amongst aggregated 		pages.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="b6d1a9511f994b3a86e2f34a32e40a34.html">Step 4: Internationalization</a></strong><br/>
For localization, or internationalization (i18n), use data binding and the 			<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel</samp> as a named model. This allows 		easily using translation keys instead of the actual texts. The alternative, using 			<dfn class="term">ResourceBundles</dfn>, requires code execution for every translated text set on a 		control.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="325b8edafcfa4c9c8fbd42455a60e379.html">Step 5: Device Model</a></strong><br/>
Before we get to the App view, there are a couple of other areas to cover. The first is 		the Device Model that we saw briefly in the Component section.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="482df92c6e8b429c8fc9022179515194.html">Step 6: Custom Utilities</a></strong><br/>
When developing an application there is always the need to reuse JavaScript coding in 		multiple views and controllers. This is achieved by storing this code in separate files in 		the util folder. The <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> modularization concept is used to dynamically load this code at 		runtime. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="31a8db9d97544bb7964a6bf18e4678ef.html">Step 7: Model View Controller</a></strong><br/>
We're using the Model View Controller (MVC) concept, and this starts with a root View 		that the Component instantiates - the App view.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="a425399ec2fe47a8b9ba9653ab4f6623.html">Step 8: Master View</a></strong><br/>
Flushed with the success of seeing our SplitApp container on the screen, we'll add the 		first main view, Master, replacing the empty skeleton we used in the Model View Controller 		section.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="08887a263aa94c14838593aecddf1529.html">Step 9: Detail View</a></strong><br/>
 We'll now add the Detail view, replacing the skeleton placeholder we had up until 		now.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="b87b4b705c144423a2fec1628b85a486.html">Step 10: Detail XML Fragments</a></strong><br/>
In the Detail View section, we referenced XML fragments in the 			<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.IconTabFilters</samp>. These fragments are separately maintainable and 		reusable collections of control declarations. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="5a6ffde8380041ffa11ed5c10431b4aa.html">Step 11: AddProduct View</a></strong><br/>
Let's round out the core functionality of the app by bringing in the facility to add a 		new product. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="9a3e13a8688144ec9e8b4075ee970224.html">Step 12: NotFound View</a></strong><br/>
