<h1 class="title topictitle1"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> Runtime Libraries Server Version Check</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">When you develop <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> applications with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> application development tools, the code
		completion and application preview features are based on <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime libraries installed
		in your Eclipse. However, after you have deployed the application to the ABAP server and
		execute it there, it will use the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime libraries installed on the ABAP
		server.</p>
<p class="p">We therefore recommended that you always have the same library version installed in
			Eclipse and on the ABAP server. If this is not the case, for example, if the local
			version is higher than the one on the server, the following could happen: </p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio152c841a8d084ba6bdbde0e824ece8a0__ul_o3s_5ym_3j"><li class="li">You may use features during development that are not yet available on the server. </li>
<li class="li">When  you test your application in Eclipse, the application may behave differently,
				for example, because in the newer runtime version some issues are fixed which still
				occur on the server.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">We recommend to check the compatibility rules which apply to <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime libraries,
			see <a class="xref" href="91f087396f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="When users and developers update to a new OpenUI5 version, it is vitally important that no applications break as a result of the upgrade. For this reason, always adhere to the compatibility rules described below when developing OpenUI5 controls and functionality.">Compatibility Rules</a>.</p>
<p class="p">When you share a <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> application project with the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> ABAP Repository, or start the
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Submit</span> wizard, a version comparison of the local libraries
			against the server is performed. If the versions differ, a warning message is shown
			which shows the current versions. If you want to proceed anyways, you can suppress the
			popup for that project and this version constellation.</p>
<p class="p">To prevent this, we recommend the following measures:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio152c841a8d084ba6bdbde0e824ece8a0__ul_aq1_31n_3j"><li class="li">Check the JavaScript documentation of the used controls and their methods for
					<samp class="ph codeph">@since</samp> tags. They indicate which version has introduced a new
				feature which you are going to use.</li>
<li class="li">When testing in Eclipse you should configure it to use the runtime libraries located
				on the server instead of the local ones, see <a class="xref" href="61ee9ed2369f4764a6d713abcf73afc1.html" title="The location of the OpenUI5 library that is used for testing may differ depending on several parameters.">SAPUI5 Library Location Used for
					Testing</a>.</li>
<li class="li">Always test your application on the server after submitting changes.</li>
