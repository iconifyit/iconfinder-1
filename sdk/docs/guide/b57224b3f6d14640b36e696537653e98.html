<p class="p">You use the APF Configuration Modeler to design or enhance your APF-based applications. </p>
<p class="p">To configure a <strong class="ph b">new</strong> application, the following steps are relevant and build on one
			another:</p>
<ol class="ol" id="loiob57224b3f6d14640b36e696537653e98__ol_ef1_bzm_kq"><li class="li">Create an <strong class="ph b">application</strong><p class="p">In this step, you create a node under which you can
					define several different configurations. This step only serves to organize
					configurations in a structured way. At runtime, the information you enter here
					is not reflected on the UI. </p>
<p class="p">All configurations that you create under one
					application node share a common text pool, that is, one text file that contains
					the texts for all configurations belonging to an application node. This is
					useful if you have configurations that have very similar content and therefore
					share large parts of their texts. Having all these texts in one text file can
					also save translation costs.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create one or more <strong class="ph b">configurations</strong><p class="p">You can define several configurations
					under one application. At runtime, only one configuration is used at a
				time.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"> Create <strong class="ph b">categories</strong> for a configuration<p class="p"> The categories you define here are
					displayed on the first level of the analysis step gallery. They help to clearly
					arrange the analysis steps, for example, by drill-down dimensions or by KPIs.
					</p>
<p class="p"> Note that the assignment of steps to categories is done manually. The
					steps cannot be assigned automatically based on their content.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create <strong class="ph b">analysis steps</strong> for each category<p class="p">Here, you define the steps that a
					user can choose from in the analysis step gallery and that make up the actual
					analysis in an APF-based application. Analysis steps have a request assigned
					that retrieves the data to be analyzed, and one or more representations that
					determine the chart types.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create <strong class="ph b">representations</strong> for each analysis step<p class="p">Representations define how
					the data of an analysis step is visualized on the UI, that is, which chart type
					is used. You can define several representations for each step so that the user
					can then select the required one in the analysis step gallery. At runtime, the
					user can switch between the different representations of a step.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create <strong class="ph b">facet filters</strong> for a configuration<p class="p"> Using facet filters, the user can
					set global filter values that apply to an entire analysis path.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create <strong class="ph b">navigation targets</strong> for a configuration<p class="p">Navigation targets are
					applications the user can navigate to from an APF-based app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">To <strong class="ph b">change</strong> an application that was shipped by SAP, you must first import the relevant
			files into the APF Configuration Modeler. You can then edit the elements listed above.
